            <p><em>Rick and Morty is an Emmy award-winning animated sitcom for adults that follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical scientist, and his grandson Morty Smith, who is more timid. The two often find themselves in trouble, which they usually manage to get out of in an entertaining way. They split their time between their home life and interdimensional adventures that take place across many realities, often traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying saucer. These adventures frequently cause problems for Morty's family, who are sometimes dragged along as well.</em></p>
